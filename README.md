# CookingSellprice
Just a simple Stardew Valley Mod which increases the value of cooked items

## What this does
Calculates the price of cooked items by adding the price of ingredients in the recipe, while not decreasing the default value. Example "Omelet" (default 125g): base item price (50g) + Egg (50g) + Milk (125g) = 225g

Because recipes don't take ingredient value into account and some recipes can require any item of a category (like fish), using better quality items or expensive fish has no effect on price.
